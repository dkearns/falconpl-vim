Falcon programming language Vim files.

If you are you using this repository then you're probably wondering
why not just use the files that come with Vim? There's no single 
answer to that but here are some things to keep in mind:

1) Odds are on most days what's here and what's in Vim is exactly 
   the same. 
2) If someone makes a request or I find a flaw I can fix I will 
   update it here first and play with for a while before 
   submitting changes downstream to Bram.
3) This repository is, by its nature, more up-to-date than what's
   in Vim, but that also means its not quite as stable.

Either way, enjoy!
