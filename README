Falcon programming language Vim files.

If you are you using this repository then you're probably wondering
why not just use the files that come with Vim? There's no single 
answer to that but here are some things to keep in mind:

1) Odds are on most days what's here and what's in Vim is exactly 
   the same. 
2) If someone makes a request or, I find a flaw that I can fix, I 
   will update it here first, and then play with it for a while 
   before submitting the change(s) downstream to Bram.
3) This repository is, by its nature, more up-to-date than what's
   in Vim, but that also means its possibly not quite as stable.

Either way, enjoy! 

         Pull requests, suggestions, and comments are 
                 all welcomed and encouraged!
